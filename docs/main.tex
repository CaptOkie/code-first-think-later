\subsection{Purpose of System}

Team projects are typically assigned in University courses in order to develop and foster
good teamwork related skills, which are crucial in most future endeavours, notably 
prospective employment. Unfortunately, the task of separating students into balanced 
and compatible teams has always been a nigh impossible feat - hardly a year passes that doesn't
boast at least a single team brimming with  contention. There just seems to be too many
nuances that are involved in building a perfect team for professors to account for, often leading
to random or pseudo-random assignment of teams. Another possibility that professors might employ
would be to allow the students themselves to form their teams. Regrettably, this option also
leads to much strife - students tend to select friends or acquaintances as partners. While this
solution might seem good, it is sadly the case that good friends often make bad project partners. 
There is also the case that many students have not made friends or acquaintances yet that they 
could ask to be their partners, thus leaving them to form a team with others in their situation.

Both current options leave much to be desired. Our firm, [\teamname{}], has been hired
to design a system that would provide a better solution to this long-standing issue. Thus, the purpose of
our system is to separate students into teams with others of similar personality and skills, eliminating 
the frequent torment associated with ill-matched teams.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This report provides an overview of the design decisions we made for the cuPID project, including 
use cases, object models, and dynamic models. The goal of this document is to clearly impart our vision of this
program to Dr. Christine Laurendeau, our esteemed employer. In furtherance to this goal, we have painstakingly 
organized our report to maximize both basic legibility and traceability. Before delving into the more complex details 
of our proposed system, we have included a general overview of the elements we wish to incorporate, as well as 
some details with regards to our unique and innovative algorithm.

Following the short synopsis, you will find, the requested requirements, cleanly organized into separate functional 
and non-functional tables. Note that each requirement is assigned a unique but informative identifier - all future references
to this particular requirement will cite its corresponding code. The purpose of the system is, again, to ensure that the
reading of this document is as simple and pleasant an experience as possible. 

Directly after the requirements, we have the various system models. We have chosen to separate them into three
primary categories: the use cases, the objects, and the dynamic models. The goal of this separation scheme is to
stagger the introduction of different components such that the reader does not feel bombarded. Thus, you will 
first see the various possible scenarios and how the system will flow with regards to these scenarios. Subsequently, 
the various objects will be introduced and described in detail. Finally, we will delve into the more detailed sequence 
diagrams that will build on information from the prior sections. This section will handle such things as timings and
the flows for the various possible states of the system.
