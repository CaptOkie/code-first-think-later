\subsection{Purpose of System}

Team projects are typically assigned in University courses in order to develop and foster
good teamwork related skills, which are crucial in most future endeavours, notably 
prospective employment. Unfortunately, the task of separating students into balanced 
and compatible teams has always been a nigh impossible feat - hardly a year passes that doesn't
boast at least a single team brimming with  contention. There just seems to be too many
nuances that are involved in building a perfect team for professors to account for, often leading
to random or pseudo-random assignment of teams. Another possibility that professors might employ
would be to allow the students themselves to form their teams. Regrettably, this option also
leads to much strife - students tend to select friends or acquaintances as partners. While this
solution might seem good, it is sadly the case that good friends often make bad project partners. 
There is also the case that many students have not made friends or acquaintances yet that they 
could ask to be their partners, thus leaving them to form a team with others in their situation.

Both current options leave much to be desired. Our firm, [\teamname{}], has been hired
to design a system that would provide a better solution to this long-standing issue. Thus, the purpose of
our system is to separate students into teams with others of similar personality and skills, eliminating 
the frequent torment associated with ill-matched teams.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This report provides an overview of the design decisions we made for the cuPID project, including 
use cases, object models, and dynamic models. The goal of this document is to clearly impart our vision of this
program to Dr. Christine Laurendeau, our esteemed employer. In furtherance to this goal, we have painstakingly 
organized our report to maximize both basic legibility and traceability. Before delving into the more complex details 
of our proposed system, we have included a general overview of the elements we wish to incorporate, as well as 
some details with regards to our unique and innovative algorithm.

Following the short synopsis, you will find, the requested requirements, cleanly organized into separate functional 
and non-functional tables. Note that each requirement is assigned a unique but informative identifier - all future references
to this particular requirement will cite its corresponding code. The purpose of the system is, again, to ensure that the
reading of this document is as simple and pleasant an experience as possible. 

Directly after the requirements, we have the various system models. We have chosen to separate them into three
primary categories: the use cases, the objects, and the dynamic models. The goal of this separation scheme is to
stagger the introduction of different components such that the reader does not feel bombarded. Thus, you will 
first see the various possible scenarios and how the system will flow with regards to these scenarios. Subsequently, 
the various objects will be introduced and described in detail. Finally, we will delve into the more detailed sequence 
diagrams that will build on information from the prior sections. This section will handle such things as timings and
the flows for the various possible states of the system.

\section{Proposed System}

\subsection{Overview}

The system that we are proposing to build offers a simplistic and clean interface designed for the single purpose of generating 
well-rounded and personality-compatible teams. To this end, we will allow two possible users: the Administrator, typically the professor,
and the Student. We want to really make a clear distinction between these two users - all that the Student user can do is access their
personal profile and control their participation to projects, while the Administration is in charge of all other aspects of project maintenance. 
Solely the Administrator will be able to run and view the results of our specialized Partner Matching Algorithm. This algorithm, broadly speaking,
will be analyzing four aspects of a person in order to generate the best possible teams:  programming or other relevant skills, leadership skills,
personality, and available. 

In this section, we will showcase a comprehensive breakdown of all the various components of our proposed system. For the sake of 
legibility, we have decided to organize the content in such a way that we move naturally from simplest to most complex - in other words,
each subsequent section builds off the previous. 

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

Functional requirements are the result of us carefully analzing the problem statement that you have submitted and extracting all the key 
desired features. In other words, we have converted your request into a list of requirements that we will fulfill. For example, you mention that
it is essential that this software can create projects. All the main features that you have expressed the desire to have have been matched with
the appropriate user and included in the following table, {\bf Table 1: Functional Requirements}. This format has the added advantage of allowing you, our employer, to see for 
yourself that each and every requirement is carried out to your satisfaction. Note again the unique identifier preceding each of the functional 
requirements - this will allow you to more easily trace our solution to each. 

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Functional Requirements}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {>{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Description\\

		F-09 & Administrators must be able to view the detailed results of the last-run PPID. \\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

Non-functional requirements are differentiable from the functional requirements in that they are not the requested features of the project, but
rather the various standards our proposed system must meet. For example, you expressed the desire that the system be designed specifically 
for use with the Linux Ubuntu platform, and that all code must be written in the C++ programming language. Also included in {\bf Table 2: None-Functional Requirements} are
assorted promises to meet various standards that you have not included in your problem statement but that either we believe should be required, 
or is required by law. Once again, each of these requirements have been assigned a unique identifier and can be used to trace our response to them.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Non-Functional Requirements}

\end{tabu}
\end{center}

\subsection{System Models}

System models are some great tools that we have decided to incorporate into our system proposition to better convey the various functionalities and
interactions in our system. They provide a strong visual representation of the various ideas that we have, including general scenarios (use-cases) such as 
"Administrator creates a new project," interactions between different objects, and precise sequence diagrams that display what each object %if control object, add here
does and for approximately how long. Specifically, you will be provided with use case diagrams with corresponding descriptions, entity objects with corresponding  
dictionaries, state machine diagrams, and sequence diagrams. 

Use case diagrams and descriptions are useful for showcasing all the possible actions we want to incorporate into our system, with the added bonus of clearly
identifying the requirements each satisfies. Entity objects delve deeper and repesent all the users and other objects in the game, listing all the attributes and associations
that each has. The purpose of including this model is to exhibit all the potential behavior and aspects each object has access to. The next model, state machines, takes a large
step backwards; here we see a more abstracted view of the system - specifically, a diagram showing the possible states that each control object can experience. In other words, this
model does not see the system as a whole, but rather focuses on a very minute aspect of the system and explains how it works. Finally. sequence diagrams
expand on the previously mentioned use cases and transforms the detailed descriptions into visual representations that also display the proportion of time spent
at each step. Furthermore, the creation and destruction of objects is also displayed in this diagram. While it can be argued that each model exhibits varying levels
of informativeness, each is required to fully understand the next.

\subsubsection{Use Case Model}

Use case models are pairings of diagrams that depicts the actions that a specified user can take in a tree-like format with detailed descriptions of each action. The actions 
are divided into two three types: the high-level cases, denoted with <<initiates>>, the detailed cases, denoted with <<include>>, and the error cases, denoted with 
<<extend>>. To augment readability, we have decided to have a separate section for the high-level cases and grouping the detailed and error cases together. One 
concession we did make was to separate the different actions by {\it User}, or actor. 

The format of this section will be separated in two parts. For the first part, we will further subdivide into two parts: the high-level use cases and the detailed use cases. 
These two sub-sections will be identically formatted insofar as the diagrams will precede the more detailed descriptions, which are organized in a clean table format. Following
this first part, the second part will contain the more detailed flow of events for every use case in the previous part (both high-level and detailed).

\subsubsection*{High-level Use Cases}

This section contains the high-level use cases - essentially, the most abstracted action each user (actor) can take. The diagram below, {\bf Figure 1}, illustrates the interaction between
users, defined by the stick figure, and the system, defined by the rectangular box. The ovals represent the highest level actions that can be taken, with a connecting line to
the user that can initiate them. Specifically, we have the {\it Student User} who can initiate the high-level action of {\it ParticipateInProjects}, and we have the {\it Administrator User} 
who can initiate in the action of {\it ManageProject}. These actions are purposefully vague and general because they are the "parent action" that includes several other more specific actions.
\vspace{1em}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imgs/high-level-use-case-diagram.png}
	\caption{High-level Use Case Diagram}
\end{figure}

Pulling the use cases from the diagram, we have next a list of the use cases in table format, {\bf Table 3}, with a short and succinct descriptions beside. The purpose of this table,
on top of having the diagram, is for ease of access with regards to information. While it is very nice to see a diagram, nothing quite beats the traditional table when
it comes to laying out data. Another benefit is, like in the case of {\it EditProfile}, it shows what detailed use cases are included in these higher-level cases.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{High-Level Use Case Descriptions}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {l >{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Name & Description\\
	    \manageenrollment{} & ManageEnrollment & The Student accesses and modifies the Projects the Student is enrolled in.\\
		\editprofile{} & EditProfile & The Student modifies the parameters of their profile (includes EditPersonalValues and EditDesiredValues).\\
		\manageproject{} & ManageProject & The Administrator manages Projects as well as having the option to create a new instance of a project (includes manipulating student participation and access to the PPID and its results).\\
		\createnewproject{} & CreateNewProject & The Administrator creates a new instance of a Project.\\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Detailed Use Cases}

This section contains the more detailed use cases - the specific cases, as it were, of the the much more general high-level use cases. Whereas the high-level cases help give a good
idea of how things are situated, detailed use cases are much more informative because they encompass all the finer details of the proposed software. Sure, it's nice to know that
an {\it Administrator} can {\it ManageProject}, but I am sure that you would agree with us that this is very vague. What exactly is "Managing Projects"? Well, that is the puprose of this 
section. 

The below figure and table, {\bf Figure 2} and {\bf Table 3}, cover the use cases that concern the {\it Administrator}. With a quick glance of the below diagram, we can see that {\it ManageProject} actually covers a 
great many details including {\it EditProject} and {\it CreateNewProject}! Note that we denote error cases with an <<extend>> relationship.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.26]{imgs/detailed-administrator-use-case-diagram.png}
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Diagram - Administrator}
\end{figure}

A picture may tell a thousand words, but, for that same reason, can often take a lot of time to fully extract necessary information. The next table, {\bf Table 4} contains 
all the information about each particular use case for the {\it Administrator}, though forgoing the actual relationships. Though we may lose that tidbit of information here, we gain a valuable 
tool that allows us to very clearly see what each use case does. 

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Descriptions - Administrator}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {l >{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Name & Description\\
		\launchppid{} & LaunchPPID & The Administrator runs the PPID for a specified Project.\\
		\insufficientstudentserror{} & InsufficientStudentsError & The system reports that there are not enough Students registered in the Project to run the PPID.\\
		\viewppidresults{} & ViewPPIDResults & The Administrator views the results of the PPID for a Project.\\
		\viewppidsummary{} & ViewPPIDSummary & The Administrator views a summary of the Groups that are created.\\
		\viewppiddetails{} & ViewPPIDDetails & The Administrator views a detailed analysis of the grouping decisions.\\
		\editprojectdetails{} & EditProjectDetails & The Administrator modifies the parameters of a specified Project.\\
		\editproject{} & EditProject & The Administrator modifies an aspect of the Project (includes Student participation and Project parameters).\\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The following figure, {\bf Figure 3}, outlines the use cases and their relationships with each other for the {\it Student User}. Note here that the {\it Student} has far fewer possible use cases
as compared to the {\it Administrator} - there are only two major things that {\it Students} can do: edit their profile, and manage their enrollment in projects. They have no 
access to finer details such as project settings. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{imgs/detailed-student-use-case-diagram.png}
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Diagram - Student}
\end{figure}

With each diagram here in the use case section, there will be an accompanying table. The ensuing table, {\bf Table 5} describes each of the possible use cases that a {\it Student User} can use/encounter.
Please also note that we have decided to not include any error cases in this particular diagram to maximize legibility.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Descriptions - Student}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {l >{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Name & Description\\
		\joinproject{} & JoinProject & The student adds themselves to an existing project.\\
		\leaveproject{} & LeaveProject & The student removes themselves from an existing project.\\
		\editpersonalvalues{} & EditPersonalValues & The student modifies the personal details in his profile (what they have to offer).\\
		\editdesiredvalues{} & EditDesiredValues & The student modifies the desired details in his profile (what they are looking for in potential team members).\\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The following diagram, {\bf Figure 4}, displays the possible ways each user can input into the system and their associated errors. Note that for most of the cases, the inputs are value-based and thus
all refer to the same {\it InvalidInputError} use case.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imgs/detailed-user-input-use-case-diagram.png}
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Diagram - User Input}
\end{figure}

{\bf Table 6}, the following table, pulls the use cases from {\bf Figure 4} and provides both a detailed description and a unique identifier for each. That said, please note that several of the cases present in {\bf Figure 4}
are absent in this table - {\it EditPersonalValues}, {\it EditDesiredValues}, and {\it EditProjectDetails} all have already been described in {\bf Table 4} and {\bf Table 5}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Descriptions - User Input}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {l >{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Name & Description\\
		\invalidinputerror{} & InvalidInputError & The system reports that the given value is invalid.\\
		\editprojectname{} & EditProjectName & The Administrator sets the name of the project. \\
		\projectexistserror{} & ProjectExistsError & The system reports that a project with the given name already exists.\\
		\editgroupsize{} & EditGroupSize & The Administrator sets the minimum and maximum group sizes to be used by the PPID. \\
		\invalidgroupsizeerror{} & InvalidGroupSizeError & The system reports that the given group size is illegal.\\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The following diagram, {\bf Figure 5}, shows which use cases, for both the {\it Administrator} and the {\it Student} Users, can trigger the {\it StorageError} use case. In other words, which of the 
priorly mentioned use cases interact with reading files, writing files, and opening the Storage.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering{}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imgs/detailed-common-error-use-case-diagram.png}
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Diagram - Common Errors}
\end{figure}

The table below, {\bf Table 7}, covers all the the descriptions and assignment of unique identifiers for the storage-related error use cases. Note that the first use case in this table, {\it StorageError}, is a generalization
of the other three use cases.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Detailed Use Case Descriptions - Common Errors}
	\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {l >{\bf}l X}
	    \tableheader{}ID & Name & Description\\
		\storageerror{} & StorageError &  The system reports that there is an error with the stored information for cuPID (generalizes StorageReadError, StorageOpenError, and StorageWriteError).\\
		\storagereaderror{} & StorageReadError & The system reports that an error occurred while attempting to read from the Storage.\\
		\storageopenerror{} & StorageOpenError & The system reports that an error occurred while attempting to open the Storage.\\
		\storagewriteerror{} & StorageWriteError & The system reports that an error occurred while attempting to write to the Storage.\\
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Table-Based Use Case Flow of Events}

In the following section, we will delve into each of the priorly mentioned use cases in much more detail. Specifically, participating actors, detailed flow of events, entry/exit conditions, quality requirements, if applicable, and 
references to which requirements each address shall all be provided for each use case. To ensure ease of reading, we will maintain the exact same ordering as listed in the above section.

The {\it ManageEnrollment} ({\bf \manageenrollment{}}) allows Student actors to both join or leave existing projects. It is a high-level use case that includes both the {\it JoinProject} and the {\it LeaveProject} use cases.

The {\it ManageProject} ({\bf \manageproject{}}) allows Administrator actors to manage project details. This is a high-level use case that
includes {\it LaunchPPID}, {\it ViewPPIDResults}, {\it EditProject}, and {\it DeleteProject}.
