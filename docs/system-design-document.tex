\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of System}

Team projects are intrinsically part of every student's academic life at some point or another. Many become resigned to losing the marks due to poor compatbility with assigned team members. This system has been designed to alleviate some of that pain by removing both the random factor and human error with regards to an educator's decision. Our system employs a special sorting algorithm that we have developed that combines psychological knowledge and research with computational reliability.

 Loosely speaking, the purpose of this system is to sort a group or class of people into groups of a specified size. However, more than just sorting people, our software takes into account a total of fifteen different characteristics of a person to determine the most optimal team that is based on more than just academic achievement. Here at [Code First, Think Later], we strongly believe that smart people don't have to like another smart person simply because they're smart.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This report will provide an updated overview of various design decisions with regards to our system. This new system aims to correct all the shortcomings of the previous prototype, as well as smooth out several other issues that we encountered during the coding of the prototype. Futhermore, at this stage of development, it is time to revise and reorganize our prototype in such a way that it adheres more closely with both a reliable architectural style and appropriate design styles. 

Beginning with a full decomposition of our prototype, we will then show a modified decomposition wherein poor design choices have been fixed. Following these decompositions, our report will feature our chosen strategies with regards to architectural and design styles. We will also be covering the details of our persistent storage system in this section. Afterwards, we will revisit the subsystems that we have decomposed in the first section and provide a detailed set of descriptions as to what services each offers in the grand scheme of things. Finally, we will end the report with a UML style set of class diagrams for each class.

\section{Subsystem Decomposition}

This section will be three-pronged - firstly, we will decompose the current working prototype into its corresponding set of logical subsystem. Following, we will introduce a more complete system decomposition, wherein we will include aspects that are not yet implemented in the current cuPID prototype. Also in this part, we will possibly modify existing subsystmes from the prototype to promote a higher degree of cohesion and minimal coupling. Finally, we will discuss the changes that we have decided on and how they impact the software as a whole.

\subsection{Design Evolution}
\subsubsection{Prototype Design Decisions}
\subsubsection{Updated Design Decisions}
\section{Design Strategies}

Similar to the previous section, this section is also divided into three major parts: architectural style, persistent data management, and design patterns. In the first part, we will describe our chosen architectural style and explain the benefits to using this particular style with regards to our system. We will also include UML deployment diagrams as a visual representation of the architecture of our software. Following this part, we will discuss our design choices with regards to our persistent data management. We will also be covering some particular cases here, such as duplicate records. Finally, we will discuss the our chosen design patterns and why they are appropriate given our decisions form the other parts in this section.

\subsection{Hardware/Software Mapping}
\subsubsection{Overview}

Our system revolves heavily upon a central storage, or repository. Other than the repository, we make use of several subsystems. Simply with this in mind, we can instantly rule out the {\it pipe and filter} architectural style - while we do indeed have subsystems (filters) that associate with each other (pipes), our subsystems are fairly dependent on one another. Furthermore, our subsystems are responsible for more than simply processing a set of inputs to get a set of outputs. 

We can also rule out the four-tier architectural style right away - our system is entirely local, thus a separate client and server layer are unnecessary. We use a login-type system, and the UI is common to any user that logs in. The only difference would be that the displayed information changes, as well as some usability. That said, this type of functionality would best fit as multiple partitions within a layer. As a result, the difference in the student and admin users should be as sister partitions within the same layer.

\subsection{Persistent Data Management}
\subsubsection{Overview}

To store the data for our system, a relational database is being used. Our relational database is built in the SQLite architecture. Multiple tables are used to store related information together, such as the \textit{students} table.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Reasoning}
\subsubsection*{Students Table (\dtref{students})}
%NEED ENTITY REFERENCE
The Student entity object has an ID, which is a unique identifier for that Student. To make sure there can only be one Student to one ID, in the \textit{students} table, (\dtref{students}), the primary key is set to the \textit{id} column. This ensures that there will duplication of an ID value. As well, by making the \textit{id} column the primary key, it shortens look up time for entries when searching by the Student's ID. The \textit{name} column does not have a constraint because the name is irrelevant to identifying a Student when a unique ID value is available. As well, it allows for Student objects with the same name to be stored in the database.

\subsubsection*{Administrator Table (\dtref{admins})}
%NEED ENTITY REFERENCE
The Admin entity object has an ID, which is a unique identifier for that Admin. To make sure there can only be one Admin to one ID, in the \textit{admins} table, (\dtref{admins}), the primary key is set to the \textit{id} column. This ensures that there will duplication of an ID value. As well, by making the \textit{id} column the primary key, it shortens look up time for entries when searching by the Admin's ID. The \textit{name} column does not have a constraint because the name is irrelevant to identifying a Admin when a unique ID value is available. As well, it allows for Student objects with the same name to be stored in the database.

\subsubsection*{projects}
Oftentimes, admins will have to create multiple projects. To assure that no duplicate projects exist, we have enforced a unique project name as the Primary Key. This assures that the admin won't confuse themselves by having several identically named projects, thus maximizing readabilit and useability. Projects also have columns storing the max and min group sizes, which are importantly distinct from one another as to allow maximum flexibility with regards to number of students enrolled in a project (for when the PPID is run).

\subsubsection*{enrollment}
Its important that each student can only enroll in each project once. To accomplish this, we have two Primary Keys - the student's unique identitier (\textit{students}.\textit{id}) and the project's unique name (\textit{projects}.\textit{name}).

\subsubsection*{questions}
- each question has unique ID so it is easy to reference 

\subsubsection*{answers}
- primary key made of foreign key to \textit{questions}.\textit{id} and \textit{id}. \\
- this allows an answer to belong to only one question. 

\subsubsection*{responses}
- using \textit{students}.\textit{id} and \textit{questions}.\textit{id}, guarantees that a student may have only one response per question.

\subsection{Design Patterns}
\subsubsection{Overview}
While organizing code with an eye to the larger picture - architectural styles - is vitally important, the smaller scale design patterns fall not far behind. Design patterns are largely independent of the architectural style insofar as nearly all design patterns can be implemented in any of the architectural patterns. They usually are used to minimize coupling across layers or to maximize cohesion across sister subsystems (partitions). This section will go over several different design patterns and explain either why we decide to use them or why we forgo their implementation. There are three main categories of design patterns that we will include in this breakdown: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioural patterns.
\subsubsection{Creational Patterns}
Patterns in this section affect how objects get created. 
\subsubsection*{Factory Method}
We have decided to implement this design pattern in our system. Add more here later.
\subsubsection{Structural Patterns}
\subsubsection*{Adapter}
This design pattern is ill suited to our particular system since we will be developing the entirety of our system. Since we will not need to write code that adapts between newer and older code, this pattern would be counter-intuitive.
\subsubsection*{Bridge}
\subsubsection*{Facade}
\subsubsection*{Proxy}
We have chosen to implement this design pattern in our system. By encompassing several of our entity objects in a proxy design, we can implement a `lazy' load-type system in that the system will only load the information that we directly ask for - nothing extra. This has the enormous benefit of reducing the memory footprint. The time trade-off is comparably minimal, even negligible. 
\subsubsection{Behavioural Patterns}
\subsubsection*{Command}
\subsubsection*{Observer}
\subsubsection*{Strategy}
