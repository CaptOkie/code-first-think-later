\section{Introduction}

Large-scale projects have always required a team to develop, design, and maintain. Unfortunately, it is rarely the case that team members are chosen based on their personalities or other such personal qualities - when you get right down to what's important to the employer, skills are paramount. Sure, the quirky, good-natured person might be favored over the quieter, unsocial person, but if that quieter person eclipsed the former with regards to talent, then they get chosen. Regrettably, the end result becomes a team of peerless talent that clash heavily on all other aspects. Maybe they're all `alpha' personalities and cannot handle not being either the center of attention or in charge. Maybe they despise the idea of sharing code with each other. Either way, the project suffers in quality because of this. Our firm, [Code First, Think Later], would like to propose in this document a potential algorithm that could solve all these problems.

\subsection{Purpose of Algorithm}

Our PPID (Project-Partner-IDentification) algorithm's purpose, as the name suggests, is, given a pool of potential team members, to sort those members into the optimal teams based on several factors including relevant skills, personality traits, leadership qualities, and degree of availability. The basis upon which the algorithm sorts the members is a set of qualifications given by each member. The qualifications themselves can be divided into two sections: the qualifications that they have, and the qualifications that they desire in a group member. By incorporating both these sets, we can more confidently ensure that the groups fit perfectly.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This document will start with basic, simple details and slowly build upwards in complexity. As such, we begin with the Qualifications section where explanations and descriptions of each of our proposed qualifications are outlined. Furthermore, we have included the scale of possible responses for each of the qualifications and assigned each a unique ID to allow maximum traceability throughout this document. Following the Qualifications section, you will find the Rules section where the algorithmic logic gets explained. Once again, each rule is assigned a unique ID. Finally, the last section will pull all the parts together and explain how the rules, when applied to the qualifications, will give optimal and consistent results.

\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Qualifications}

\subsubsection{Overview of Qualifications}

The following table, \tableref{oq}, gives a simple overview of the different qualifications that we are accounting for in our algorithms. Alongside each, there is a unique ID, as well as a category for that particular qualification. We have included four different categories: skills, leadership, personality, and availability. Finally, you will find a short description of each qualification.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Detailed Breakdown of Qualifications}

\tableref{dq01} below gives a more detailed explanation of {\bf QF-01}. It explains the importance of the COMP 2401 grade in the scheme of generating teams for Software Engineering.

		Reasoning & COMP 2401, Introduction to Systems Programming, is a second year course whose material covers some of the basic but essential components of systems programming. These components include, but are not limited to: memory management, program design, and data types.A strong understanding of the basic and fundamentals of systems programming is essential to creating a good, clean program. Without the skills learned in this class, software may be poorly managed with regards to memory allocations, file divisions, and use of the dreaded global variables.\\

\tableref{dq03} below gives a more detailed explanation of {\bf QF-03}. It explains the importance of report writing in the software development lifecycle.

				\item[3.] It's okay I guess.
				\item[4.] I enjoy writing!
				\item[5.] Just call me Shakespeare 2.0.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & Report writing is typically seen as a crucial University skill to have. For the purpose of Software Engineering, it becomes important when it comes time to start writing up the deliverables. Knowing how to punctuate, as well as how to structure sentences, are vitally important.\\

\tableref{dq04} below gives a more detailed explanation of {\bf QF-04}. It explains the importance of debugging software in the software development lifecycle.

				\item[4.] I have a good idea of where the bugs usually happen so I'm pretty fast at debugging!
				\item[5.] Ha. Please. I'm so good at debugging, you wouldn't even have time to notice any bugs before they're fixed.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & It's nearly impossible that a given software runs flawlessly the first time it gets run. Debugging software is something of an art! Being able to break a program to assure that all test cases work is vital.\\

\tableref{dq05} below gives a more detailed explanation of {\bf QF-05}. It explains the importance of being comfortable having and using power in the context of group leaders.

				\item[4.] I'm pretty happy taking charge of situations.
				\item[5.] DANCE FOR ME, MY PUPPETS, DANCE!\cite{himym}
			\end{enumerate}

				\item[4.] Everything has its place and I can almost always find them there.
				\item[5.] My notes are cross-referenced, professionally labelled, and filed.

				\item[4.] I am pretty comfortable with making tough choices.
				\item[5.] I live for the thrill that you get from making enormous, life-changing decisions.

				\item[4.] I like stepping up and taking charge.
				\item[5.] Moot question - I'm always always at `the plate'.
			\end{enumerate}

				\item[4.] I prefer starting earlier rather than later.
				\item[5.] New assignment today? Please, I finished that yesterday.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & Like people tend to get along. One of the major causes of contention in groups is work ethic - some people eagerly work early on and finish early as well, whereas  others prefer waiting until the last minute. Generally speaking, combining the two is a terrible idea.\\

				\item[3.] If they look approachable I might say hello.
				\item[4.] I enjoy speaking with strangers.
				\item[5.] I'm that guy that sits by the garbage and tries to talk with everyone that comes to throw out their trash.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & Sociability is an important personality factor to consider when making teams because if a team consists entirely of social people except one, the odd member may feel dejected and ignored. On the otherhand, a team of anti-social people except one would have similar effects.\\
		References & Morgeson\cite{morgeson}\\

		Scale for Responses &
		\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item[1.] I start everything at once and distribute my time across everything evenly.
				\item[2.] I try to do a bit of everything, but I tend to get excited/focused on one part and finish it completely.
				\item[3.] I try to do things one a time, but usually end up starting multiple things anyways.
				\item[4.] I focus on one thing at a time until it's finished.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & Work habits are an aspect of a person's personality that may result in intra-group contention - if one member is trying to finish things one-by-one whereas the other is just starting everything at once, work may overlap and get difficult to correctly organize.\\

				\item[3.] About on time - perhaps a few minutes either way.
				\item[4.] Several minutes early.
				\item[5.] At least an hour or so before.
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & Punctuality, while not limited to groups, is an issue that can lead to heavy annoyance. Always having that one guy that arrives an hour late can lead to internal strife.\\

				\item[4.] A bit of an early bird (9AM or so).
				\item[5.] A the break of dawn, or earlier, or course! 6AM or so).
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}\\
		Reasoning & The worst thing when trying to coordinate working on group projects is having that one guy that can only work at obscenely early or late hours or the day. Having a group with common working times is vitally important.\\

				\item[5.] Every day is a good day.
			\end{enumerate}

				\item[4.] All hail the Internet - I work primarily through e-mails.
				\item[5.] I got a fancy smart phone - I only operate via text messages!
			\end{enumerate}

		Reasoning & It's nice to have a common mode of communication within groups - it allows simple and consistent communication between any and all group members. It's always annoying to have that one guy that only answers his phone and everyone else works through email.\\
